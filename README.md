#  Grocery Store Management ‚Äì SQL Project

Welcome to my SQL-based Grocery Store Management project! This project simulates the data system of a mini grocery store and answers key business questions using SQL queries.

---

##  Project Contents

- `grocery_schema.sql` ‚Äì Contains the **SQL schema**, i.e., database creation and table definitions.
- `grocery_queries.sql` ‚Äì Contains all **SQL queries** to extract insights and answer business questions.
- `README.md` ‚Äì You‚Äôre reading it now üòä

##  What This Project Is About

This project helps analyze and manage data related to a grocery store‚Äôs:
- Products and their suppliers
- Customers and their orders
- Employee performance
- Sales and revenue trends

The database includes **7 interrelated tables**:
- `supplier`
- `categories`
- `employees`
- `customers`
- `products`
- `orders`
- `order_details`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Table Creation and Data Import

We intentionally **create tables and import data one by one in the defined order**, instead of running all table creation scripts together. Here's why:

### Reason:
When all tables are created at once, tools like **MySQL Workbench** automatically arrange them **alphabetically** in the schema browser on the left side. This can cause confusion because:

- The **logical flow and relationships** between tables (e.g., supplier ‚Üí products ‚Üí orders) are not visible in order.
- It's harder to **track dependencies and foreign keys** while importing data.
- It can be overwhelming for learners to understand how the data is connected.

### Our Approach:
We follow this logical sequence:
1. `supplier`
2. `categories`
3. `employees`
4. `customers`
5. `products`
6. `orders`
7. `order_details`

This approach:
- Maintains **clarity and structure**
- Makes **debugging easier**
- Helps in **learning relational database design** effectively

##  Key Objectives

- Design a relational database schema using SQL
- Use SQL queries to extract business insights
- Analyze customer behavior, product sales, employee activity, and trends

##  Business Analysis Questions Covered

The project answers **real-world business questions** like:


Analysis Questions:

1Ô∏è. Customer Insights

How many unique customers have placed orders?

Which customers have placed the highest number of orders?

What is the total and average purchase value per customer?

Who are the top 5 customers by total purchase amount?

2. Product Performance

How many products exist in each category?

What is the average price of products by category?

Which products have the highest total sales volume (by quantity)?

What is the total revenue generated by each product?

How do product sales vary by category and supplier?

3. Sales and Order Trends

How many orders have been placed in total?

What is the average value per order?

On which dates were the most orders placed?

What are the monthly trends in order volume and revenue?

How do order patterns vary across weekdays and weekends?

4Ô∏è. Supplier Contribution

How many suppliers are there in the database?

Which supplier provides the most products?

What is the average price of products from each supplier?

Which suppliers contribute the most to total product sales (by revenue)?

5Ô∏è. Employee Performance

How many employees have processed orders?

Which employees have handled the most orders?

What is the total sales value processed by each employee?

What is the average order value handled per employee?

6Ô∏è. Order Details Deep Dive

What is the relationship between quantity ordered and total price?

What is the average quantity ordered per product?

How does the unit price vary across products and orders?


These insights are generated using a wide range of **SQL skills**: joins, subqueries, aggregations, grouping, date manipulation, and more.

## SQL Concepts Used

- `JOINs` (Inner, Left)
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- Aggregation: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`
- Subqueries
- `CASE` statements
- Date formatting using `STR_TO_DATE()`, `MONTHNAME()`, `DAYNAME()`

---

##  Tools Used

- **MySQL / SQL Workbench** for database creation and querying
- **PowerPoint** for visual storytelling of business insights
