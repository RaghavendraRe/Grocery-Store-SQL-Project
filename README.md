# 🛒 Grocery Store Management – SQL Project

Welcome to my SQL-based project for Grocery Store Management! This project simulates the data system of a mini grocery store and answers key business questions using SQL queries.

---

##  Project Contents

- `grocery_schema.sql` – Contains the **SQL schema**, i.e., database creation and table definitions.
- `grocery_queries.sql` – Contains all **SQL queries** to extract insights and answer business questions.
- `Data sets.zip`  – Sample data used to populate the database tables.
- `grocery erdiagram.png` – ER diagram representing the database structure.
- `README.md` – You’re reading it now 😊

##  What This Project Is About

This project helps analyze and manage data related to a grocery store’s:
- Products and their suppliers
- Customers and their orders
- Employee performance
- Sales and revenue trends

The database includes **7 interrelated tables**:
- `supplier`
- `categories`
- `employees`
- `customers`
- `products`
- `orders`
- `order_details`

## ⚠️ Note on Table Creation and Data Import

 **create tables and import data one by one in a specific order** instead of executing all scripts together.

###  Why?
Tools like **MySQL Workbench** automatically arrange tables **alphabetically** in the schema browser when all are created at once. This can cause confusion because:
- The **logical flow of data** (e.g., supplier → products → orders) isn’t clear.
- It's harder to **understand foreign key relationships**.
- It becomes confusing for beginners trying to debug or track dependencies.

###  Our Approach
We follow this **logical order** to maintain clarity:
1. `supplier`
2. `categories`
3. `employees`
4. `customers`
5. `products`
6. `orders`
7. `order_details`

This makes learning relational databases easier and debugging smoother.

##  Key Objectives

- Design a relational database schema using SQL
- Use SQL queries to extract business insights
- Analyze customer behavior, product sales, employee activity, and trends

##  Business Analysis Questions Covered

This project answers real-world business questions such as:

### 1. Customer Insights
- How many unique customers have placed orders?
- Which customers have placed the highest number of orders?
- What is the total and average purchase value per customer?
- Who are the top 5 customers by total purchase amount?

### 2. Product Performance
- How many products exist in each category?
- What is the average price of products by category?
- Which products have the highest total sales volume (by quantity)?
- What is the total revenue generated by each product?
- How do product sales vary by category and supplier?

### 3. Sales and Order Trends
- How many orders have been placed in total?
- What is the average value per order?
- On which dates were the most orders placed?
- What are the monthly trends in order volume and revenue?
- How do order patterns vary across weekdays and weekends?

### 4. Supplier Contribution
- How many suppliers are there in the database?
- Which supplier provides the most products?
- What is the average price of products from each supplier?
- Which suppliers contribute the most to total product sales (by revenue)?

### 5. Employee Performance
- How many employees have processed orders?
- Which employees have handled the most orders?
- What is the total sales value processed by each employee?
- What is the average order value handled per employee?

### 6. Order Details Deep Dive
- What is the relationship between quantity ordered and total price?
- What is the average quantity ordered per product?
- How does the unit price vary across products and orders?

These insights are generated using a wide range of **SQL skills** including joins, subqueries, aggregations, grouping, and date-based analysis.

---

##  SQL Concepts Used

- `JOINs` (INNER, LEFT)
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- Aggregations: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`
- Subqueries
- `CASE` statements
- Date formatting: `STR_TO_DATE()`, `MONTHNAME()`, `DAYNAME()`

---

##  Tools Used

- **MySQL / MySQL Workbench** for database creation and querying
- **PowerPoint** for visual storytelling of business insights
- **GitHub** for version control and project hosting

##  ER Diagram

The database structure is illustrated below:

---

##  Datasets

All `.csv` files used for importing data into tables are available in the `/datasets` folder or as a ZIP file (`grocery_datasets.zip`), including:

- `supplier.csv`
- `categories.csv`
- `employees.csv`
- `customers.csv`
- `products.csv`
- `orders.csv`
- `order_details.csv`

You can import these into your SQL tool to populate the tables after creating the schema.

---

##  How to Run This Project

1. Open MySQL Workbench or any SQL client.
2. Run `grocery_schema.sql` to create all tables in the correct order.
3. Import data from CSVs one by one using the table names.
4. Run `grocery_queries.sql` to perform analysis and extract insights.
5. Use the ER diagram and PowerPoint slides for presentation if needed.
